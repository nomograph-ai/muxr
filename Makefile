# Create the .agent/skills compat symlink fresh on every build.
# Pointing .agent/skills at .claude/skills (relative) lets agent
# harnesses that read from .agent/ (per the AGENTS.md ecosystem
# convention) see the same skills muxr exposes via .claude/.
# The symlink is intentionally untracked in git: tools that rewrite
# symlinks (e.g. some rune sync versions) cannot break a file that
# was never committed. Each clone or build regenerates it relative,
# which is the only form that survives both the local checkout and
# the CI clone path.
